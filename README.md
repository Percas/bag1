# bag1
Python programs to process BAG XML files from Kadaster Netherlands, counting VBO's, Panden etc.
In order to use these Python scripts you need to set up a directory structure 01-xml, 02-csv, 03-bewerktedata.
A program starting with 12-... operates between directories (=resting points) 01-xml and 02-csv.
