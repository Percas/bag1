# bag1
Python programs to process BAG XML files from Kadaster Netherlands, counting VBO's, Panden etc.
In order to use these Python scripts you need to set up a directory structure\n
  01-xml\n
  02-csv\n
  03-bewerktedata.\n
A program starting with 12-... operates between directories (=resting points) 01-xml and 02-csv
